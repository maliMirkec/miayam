### The Brutalist Blog Site Built & Designed By Muhammad D. R.

A blog site to store thoughts and ideas. Built and designed solely by yours
truly. It stays being true to itself. An entity that is an inhabitant of the
web. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and everything in between bundled together. It's
ugly, brutal, a dead simple site, a sore to the eyes, but having no more than
is really needed.

This project also includes a starter pack to up and run with `11ty`. Look into
`init` branch.

## Introduction

A starter project to rebuild miayam.io from the ground up using Eleventy and friends. It
is a foundation on which miayam.io is going to built. Removing Jekyll entirely from the code base.

## Why Migrating From Jekyll to Eleventy?

At first, miayam.io was a personal blog site built with Jekyll using a theme I picked carelessly
which I didn't quite understand how to work with. The more I tinker with it, the more befuddled I am.
So, I decided to burn it down and rebuild it from the ground up. I was looking for an alternative to
Jekyll written in JavaScript because I am a boring web developer you could find anywhere else. I have
tried Gatsby and wound up getting bored. All those shiny new technologies Gatsby have to offer are
not what I need. I have tried Hexo, it had similar ambience with Jekyll but it didn't spark joy. And
then, there was Eleventy... It really is like a magical glove that just fit my brain perfectly. It
does one thing and does it well. A simple SSG that is having no more than is really needed.
