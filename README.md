# The Brutalist Blog Site Built & Designed By Muhammad D. R.

A blog site to store thoughts and ideas. Built and designed solely for yours
truly. It stays being true to itself. An entity that is an inhabitant of the
web. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and everything in between bundled together. It's
ugly, brutal, a dead simple site, a sore to the eyes, but having no more than
is really needed.

This project also includes a starter pack to up and run with `11ty`. Look into
`init` branch.
